        When Worcester firefighters raced to extinguish a four-alarm blaze last spring, they weren’t just battling flames; they were contributing to an increase in overtime spending that has strained the city’s budget. This scene, repeated multiple times, identifies a growing issue in Worcester’s fire department, where overtime costs have increased so much in recent years. In 2018, total overtime pay was $1.55 million; by 2022, that figure had more than tripled to $4.96 million. Despite a slight decrease to $4.18 million in 2023, the expenses are still significantly greater than they were prior to the pandemic.

        <h2>Overtime Spending by Year, 2018-2023</h2>

            This line chart shows the trends in overtime spending for Worcester’s Fire Department from 2018 to 2023. The chart reveals relatively stable overtime costs between 2018 and 2020, with spending consistently around $1.5 million each year. However, in 2022, overtime spending saw a significant spike, reaching nearly $5 million, driven by factors such as staffing shortages and an increased demand for public safety services. In 2023, overtime costs slightly decreased to approximately $4 million, suggesting some stabilization or adjustments in staffing and scheduling practices. This chart shows the substantial fluctuations in overtime spending and explains the ongoing financial challenges faced by the Fire Department in managing these costs.
    </figure>
</div>


    <p>
        The sharp increase in overtime costs can be attributed to several factors, including staffing shortages, expanded firefighter shifts, and changes in the city’s staffing policies. In 2021, for instance, the city decided to raise the number of firefighters per truck from three to four, a decision aimed at improving safety and efficiency. While it was an essential move, it resulted in a 71% spike in overtime spending that year. Additionally, the city expanded paid time off for firefighters, which also contributed to the rise in overtime, as more shifts had to be filled by available staff. Worcester's overtime spending in public safety is similar to trends seen in other cities across Massachusetts. Fire and public safety departments, which often face staffing shortages, rely heavily on overtime, driving up costs. In Boston, for example, overtime spending in these departments is also high, reflecting similar challenges.
    Across the state, public safety overtime costs have risen, highlighting how cities are struggling to balance their budgets while meeting critical safety needs. Worcester’s situation raises a key question: is this just part of a statewide trend, or does the city have unique challenges that require a different approach?

            The comparative chart shows overtime spending for public safety departments in Worcester and Cambridge from 2018 to 2023. While both cities saw increasing overtime costs from 2018 to 2020, Cambridge's overtime spending continued to rise each year, peaking at over $5 million in 2023. Worcester, on the other hand, experienced a sharp increase in 2022, reaching about $5 million, before slightly decreasing to $4 million in 2023. This trend shows Cambridge's ongoing escalation in overtime costs, while Worcester has made some efforts to manage and reduce those costs from last year.

        <h2>OT Salary Distribution by Year for Fire, Police, and Other Departments in Worcester </h2>

	This chart presents the distribution of overtime (OT) salary spending across Fire, Police, and other municipal departments from 2018 to 2023. It highlights how overtime costs are allocated among the departments and tracks changes over time. The data shows that all departments experienced a significant increase in 2022.The significant increase in overtime spending across all departments in 2022 can be attributed to several factors, including staffing shortages, lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and unforeseen emergencies.  Additionally, policy changes, such as extended shifts or increased safety measures, contributed to the rise in overtime hours, as departments worked to meet service demands.
    </figure>
</div>


    <p>
       Tom Matthews, a Worcester public relations officer, explained that overtime costs are largely event—and absence-dependent. He said, “Public safety shifts must be filled regardless of the budget implications.” This situation is worsened by an ongoing staffing shortage, meaning that firefighters often have to work overtime to fill shifts, especially when there are unfilled positions.

The financial cost of this overtime burden is more than just a number on a budget sheet; it shows the increased pressure on Worcester’s public safety workers to handle more emergencies and shifts. The rise in overtime reflects the challenges of staffing and managing these departments effectively. Fire lieutenants, in particular, are among the highest overtime earners. In 2023, one lieutenant earned $84,730 in overtime alone, a sum that exceeds the salary of many full-time employees in other industries. While these overtime paychecks are financially rewarding for some, they also raise concerns about the impact of long shifts and constant emergency responses on firefighters’ physical and mental well-being. “Firefighters are committed to the job and to the community,” Matthews said. “But there’s no denying that this level of overtime is taxing.”

	<p>
        The city’s emergency communications department, which handles 911 calls, has faced similar pressures. A senior dispatcher in 2023 earned nearly $70,000 in overtime, largely due to unfilled positions. This has led to additional strain on existing staff who are forced to take on extra shifts, further pushing up overtime pay.
One of the main drivers of these rising costs is the structure of overtime pay. Firefighters earn time-and-a-half for every hour worked beyond their scheduled shifts, which means that during busy periods, overtime pay can quickly accumulate. Specialized roles, such as lieutenants and captains, tend to have higher base salaries, which makes their overtime pay even more expensive for the city.
    </p>

   

    <p>
        Emergency response is inherently unpredictable. Large-scale incidents, such as fires or severe weather events, require significant resources, which can extend shifts beyond normal working hours. This unpredictability makes it difficult for city officials to control overtime spending without jeopardizing public safety. While some level of overtime is unavoidable, critics argue that the city should explore alternatives, such as hiring additional staff or adjusting shifts, to mitigate the financial burden.
</p>

<p>
For Worcester taxpayers, the rising overtime costs are a growing concern. Worcester’s property taxes, which are the city's primary revenue source, are used to fund public safety operations. However, the city’s budget has been stretched thin by the increased costs of public safety staffing, further complicated by the fact that a significant portion of the city’s land and property value is tax-exempt. This imbalance means that taxable properties bear a greater share of the cost. In 2023, the city’s property tax rate was set at $22.51 per $1,000 of assessed value, with residents shouldering the burden of rising costs. However, with a tax-exempt land base, including many municipal buildings and state-owned properties, the city’s fiscal health remains vulnerable. Worcester’s unused tax levy capacity—currently at $21.3 million—could help address these growing financial challenges without raising taxes, but city leaders must carefully evaluate how best to manage this capacity.
    </p>

    <p>
	In response to these mounting costs, the city has worked to better account for overtime overruns during its budgeting process. Each year, the City must balance revenues, such as state aid, property taxes, and local receipts, with fixed costs and new initiatives. “Based on historical trend analysis, contracted salary increases, new policies, and procedures resulting in potential overtime, we attempt to increase funding where needed and possible,” explained Eliana Agudelo, Chief of Staff for Mayor Joseph M. Petty. “After the start of the fiscal year, overtime costs are primarily addressed through internal departmental transfers from salaries or ordinary maintenance to cover overtime needs.”
The city has also been actively implementing measures to curb overtime costs. Each department is tasked with carefully reviewing base staffing needs, assignments, and attendance to ensure overtime remains manageable. In certain circumstances, overtime is required due to staff vacancies, unanticipated emergencies, or unexpected employee leave. “At the Worcester Fire Department (WFD), for example, an increase in the number of firefighters per vehicle has increased the potential for overtime to ensure adequate coverage,” Agudelo added. “To offset this, the City has added 35 new positions to the WFD since FY20, and we’ve modified the responsibilities of key lieutenants to allow for cross-coverage of shifts without the need for more overtime.”
</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, the city has worked with the emergency communications department's union to create a 12-hour shift system. This shift design provides greater coverage throughout the day and reduces the impact of absences on staffing needs. While it creates some mandatory overtime, it also reduces the need for full-shift overtime, offering potential savings over the long term. The Worcester Police Department has created a precinct-based system that provides greater oversight of shifts and improved staff planning, reducing overtime where possible.
	</p>
	
	<p>
        Despite these measures, challenges remain. The unpredictable nature of emergencies and ongoing staffing shortages mean that overtime will continue to play a role in meeting the city's public safety demands. As Worcester works to address these issues, other cities across Massachusetts are looking closely at similar trends and solutions.
The slight decrease in overtime spending in 2023 may suggest some stabilization, but it’s too soon to tell if this is a lasting trend. Addressing the root causes of overtime expenditures—such as vacancies, expanded shifts, and increasing demand for services—will require a coordinated effort among city leaders, department heads, and unions. “We are constantly evaluating ways to manage costs while maintaining the high level of service our residents expect,” Matthews concluded.
